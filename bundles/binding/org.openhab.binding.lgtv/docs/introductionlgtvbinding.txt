Hi Everybody, 

I'm happy to announce first version of the lgtv binding (My first lines of code since 6 years or so ;-) The Binding is based on UDAP Spec http://developer.lgappstv.com/TV_HELP/topic/lge.tvsdk.references.book/html/UDAP/UDAP/UDAP%20Specifications%20For%20Second%20Screen%20TV%20and%20Companion%20Apps.htm
covering LGTV Models with netcast 3.0 platform (2012&2013) based on UDAP Specification http://developer.lgappstv.com/TV_HELP/topic/lge.tvsdk.references.book/html/UDAP/UDAP/UDAP%20Specifications%20For%20Second%20Screen%20TV%20and%20Companion%20Apps.htm

Thanks to the work of Pauli Anttila / the binding is based on the Onkyo Binding. 

The following commands of the interface are implemented:
- pairing
- handlekeyinput  (every key of the remote control) 
- handlechannelchange
- load application list
- load channel list
- start application
- stop application
- getvolume 
- handlevolumechange (wrapper as the api only supports keyinput) 

The following events are implemented
- handlechannelchange
- byebye

As there is no event covering changes of the volume the regular keepalive check is done via getvolume command. 

A server thread waits for connections from the tv to receive the events. 
A checkavailiability thread checks if the tv comes up to fire a statechange - so rules can wait for the tv coming up. 

To get the availiable channels an the availiable applications xml files are created if configuration is set. 

The binding is running in my house with a LG60LA7408 since about one week now - especially sourcode documentation & logging have to be optimized / currently messages are sent only in "debug" level. 

For details regarding the functionalities & configuration consult the attached readme. Sourcecode will follow when I'm happy with the sourcedoc. 

To announce beforehand my availiabilty in the group & via mail is really bad - so prepare for late answers. 

If there is anybody in the group who has an installed lgtv development environ: I would appreciate a small lgtv app which implemnts the lgtv app2app api to "remote control" the lg's browser. 
thats the main reason for the binding - with this function your tv get's an openhab console / remote controlled by the rules engine.
